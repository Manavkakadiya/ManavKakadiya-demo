This Assignment implements a classical machine learning pipeline for recognizing six basic facial emotions: anger, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise, using the JAFFE and Cohn-Kanade datasets. It explores hand-crafted feature extractors (LBP and HOG) in combination with traditional classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, KNN, etc.). The pipeline includes preprocessing, feature extraction, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation through metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices. SVM with HOG features delivered the highest performance, achieving 83.6% accuracy on JAFFE and 61.3% on Cohn Kanade. This work serves as a transparent, interpretable benchmark for FER on resource-constrained systems.
